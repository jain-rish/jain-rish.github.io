A Machine Learning tool to assess Protein Quality

Protein Quality is assessed using Electrophoresis
Protein production is a multi-billion dollar business, and companies are trying to not only increase production but also improve quality.  Protein quality is commonly assessed using electrophoresis.  Gel electrophoresis is the experimental method to separate proteins into its fragments based on their size.  When a voltage gradient is induced across a gel, the heavier proteins flow down the electric river much more slowly than the lighter ones.  These fragments show up under UV exposure as separated individual bands.
